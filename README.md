# Highscore

This app is my first attempt at using Rails as an API for a client-side Javascript application. The application is a WWII shoot-em-up built with Phaser.js as outlined in [HTML5 Shoot 'em Up in an Afternoon](https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon).

## Features

* After defeating the boss, players will be given the option of entering a name to associate with their score

* After entering a name, their score will be displayed along with similarly ranked scores.
